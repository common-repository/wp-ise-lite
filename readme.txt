Which results do you want to display on your website? Do need an improved search engine for an enhanced user experience? You're there!

== Description ==

*WP-ISE: the Improved Search Engine for WordPress* is a WordPress dedicated search engine, built with a single and simple goal in mind: offer a better search engine to WordPress, as the default one is not very useful. Works out of the box, no settings, just install it and activate it.

There are already good plugins in the same area, so I've looked at all of them, and built some kind of 'mega-fork&mix', getting ideas and solutions from each of them.

The plugin exists in Lite / Pro / Ultimate editions, you can find more info on the [WP-ISE official website](http://www.wp-ise.com/).

== Installation ==

- from wordpress.org plugins directory
1. Download wp-ise-lite.zip from wordpress.org and unzip it
2. Upload `wp-ise-lite` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

- using the built in WordPress plugin installer
1. search for WP-ISE
2. install the plugin
3. activate it

Put the search widget in a sidebar, or a search form somewhere on your pages.
That's all. Enjoy!

== Frequently asked questions ==
